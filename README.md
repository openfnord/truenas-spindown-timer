# TrueNAS Spindown Timer

_Monitors drive I/O and forces HDD spindown after a given idle period. Resistant to S.M.A.R.T. reads._

Disk spindown has always been an issue for various TrueNAS / FreeNAS users. This
script utilizes `iostat` to detect I/O operations (reads, writes) on each disk.
If a disk was neither read nor written for a given period of time, it is
considered idle and is spun down.

Periodic reads of S.M.A.R.T. data performed by the smartctl service are
excluded. This allows users to have S.M.A.R.T. reporting enabled while still
being able to automatically spin down disks. The script moreover is immune to
the periodic disk temperature reads in newer versions of TrueNAS.

Successfully tested on:
  * `TrueNAS-12.0-U8.1 (Core)`
  * `TrueNAS-12.0 (Core)`
  * `FreeNAS-11.3`
  * `FreeNAS-11.2`

A full list of all tested TrueNAS / FreeNAS versions can be found at the end of
this file.


## Key Features

  * Periodic S.M.A.R.T. reads do not reset the disk idle timers
  * Configurable idle timeout and poll interval
  * Support for ATA and SCSI devices
  * Per-disk idle timer / Independent spindown
  * Automatic detection or explicit listing of drives to monitor
  * Ignoring of specific drives (e.g. SSD with system dataset)
  * Executable via `Tasks` as `Post-Init Script`, configurable via TrueNAS GUI
  * Allows script placement on encrypted pool
  * Optional shutdown after configurable idle time


## Usage

```
Usage: spindown_timer.sh [-h] [-q] [-v] [-d] [-m] [-t TIMEOUT] [-p POLL_TIME] [-i DRIVE] [-s TIMEOUT]

Monitors drive I/O and forces disk spindown after a given idle period.
Resistant to S.M.A.R.T. reads.

A drive is considered as idle and is spun down if there has been no I/O
operations on it for at least TIMEOUT seconds. I/O requests are evaluated
during intervals with a length of POLL_TIME seconds. Detected reads or
writes reset the drives timer back to TIMEOUT.

Options:
  -q           : Quiet mode. Outputs are suppressed if flag is present.
  -v           : Verbose mode. Prints additonal information during execution.
  -d           : Dry run. No actual spindown is performed.
  -m           : Manual mode. If this flag is set, the automatic drive detection
                 is disabled.
                 This inverts the -i switch, which then needs to be used to supply
                 each drive to monitor. All other drives will be ignored.
  -t TIMEOUT   : Number of seconds to wait for I/O in total before considering
                 a drive as idle.
  -p POLL_TIME : Number of seconds to wait for I/O during a single iostat call.
  -i DRIVE     : In automatic drive detection mode (default): Ignores the given
                 drive and never issue a spindown command for it.
                 In manual mode [-m]: Only monitor the specified drives.
                 Multiple drives can be given by repeating the -i switch.
  -s TIMEOUT   : Shutdown timeout, if no drive is active for TIMEOUT seconds, 
                 the system will be shut down 
  -h           : Print this help message.
```

## Deployment and configuration

The following steps describe how to configure TrueNAS and deploy the script.


### Configure disk standby settings

To prevent the smartctl daemon or TrueNAS from interfering with spun down disks,
open the TrueNAS GUI and navigate to `Storage > Disks`.

For every disk that you would like to spin down, click the `Edit` button. Then
set the `HDD Standby` option to `Always On` and `Advanced Power Management` to
level 128 or above. 

![HDD standby settings](screenshots/disk-spindown-config.png)

_Note: In older versions of FreeNAS it was required to set the S.M.A.R.T `Power
Mode` to `Standby`. This setting was configured globally and was located under
`Services > S.M.A.R.T. > Configure`._


### Deploy script

Copy the script to your NAS box and set the execution permission through `chmod
+x spindown_timer.sh`.

That's it! The script can now be run, e.g., in a `tmux` session. However, an
automatic start during boot is highly recommended (see next section).


### Automatic start at boot

There are multiple ways to start the spindown timer after system boot. The
easiest one is to register it as an `Init Script` via the TrueNAS GUI. This can
be done by opening the GUI and navigating to `Tasks > Init/Shutdown Scripts`.
Here, create a new `Post Init` task that executes `spindown_timer.sh` after
boot.

![Spindown timer post init task](screenshots/task.png)

_Note: Be sure to select `Command` as `Type`_

_Note: With FreeNAS-11.3 a `Timeout` was introduced. However, the spindown
script is never terminated by FreeNAS, regardless of the configured value.
Therefore, keep `Timeout` at the default value of 10 seconds for now._


#### Delayed start (Script placed in encrypted pool)

If you placed the script at a location that is not available right after boot, a
delayed start of the spindown timer is required. This, for example, applies when
the script is located inside an encrypted pool, which needs to be unlocked prior
to execution.

To automatically delay the start until the script file becomes available, the
helper script `delayed_start.sh` is provided. It takes the full path to the
spindown timer script as the first argument. All additional arguments are passed
to the called script once available. Example usage: `./delayed_start.sh
/mnt/pool/spindown_timer.sh -t 3600 -p 600`

The `delayed_start.sh` script, however, must again be placed in a location that
is available right after boot. To circumvent this problem, you can also use the
following one-liner directly within an `Init/Shutdown Script`, as shown in the
screenshot below. Set `SCRIPT` to the path where the `spindown_timer.sh` file is
stored and configure all desired call arguments by setting them via the `ARGS`
variable. The `CHECK` variable determines the delay between execution attempts
in seconds.

```bash
/bin/bash -c 'SCRIPT="/mnt/pool/spindown_timer.sh"; ARGS="-t 3600 -p 600"; CHECK=60; while true; do if [ -f "${SCRIPT}" ]; then ${SCRIPT} ${ARGS}; break; else sleep ${CHECK}; fi; done'
```

_Note: Be sure to select `Command` as `Type`_

_Note: With FreeNAS-11.3 a `Timeout` was introduced. However, the spindown
script is never terminated by FreeNAS, regardless of the configured value.
Therefore, keep `Timeout` at the default value of 10 seconds for now._


#### Verify autostart

You can verify execution of the script either via a process manager like `htop`
or simply by using the following command: `ps -aux | grep "spindown_timer.sh"`

When using a delayed start, keep in mind that it can take up to `$CHECK` seconds
before the script availability is updated and the spindown timer is finally
executed.


### Verify drive spindown (optional)

It can be useful to check the current power state of a drive. This can be done
by using one of the following commands, depending on your device type.


#### ATA drives

The current power mode of an ATA drive can be checked using the command
`camcontrol epc $drive -c status -P`, where `$drive` is the drive to check
(e.g., `ada0`).

It should return `Current power state: Standby_z(0x00)` for a spun down drive.


#### SCSI drives

The current power mode of a SCSI drive can be checked through reading the
modepage `0x1a` using the command `camcontrol modepage $drive -m 0x1a`, where
`$drive` is the drive to check (e.g., `da0`).

A spun down drive should be in one of the standby states `Standby_y` or
`Standby_z`.

A detailed description of the available SCSI modes can be found in
`/usr/share/misc/scsi_modes`.


## Advanced usage

In the following section, advanced usage scenarios are described.


### Automatic drive detection vs manual mode [-m]

In automatic mode (default) all drives of the system, excluding the ones
specified using the `-i` switch, are monitored and spun down if idle.

In scenarios where only a small subset of all available drives should be spun
down, the manual mode can be used by setting the `-m` flag.  This disables
automatic drive detection and inverts the `-i` switch. It can then be used to
specify all drives that should explicitly get monitored and spun down when idle.

An example in which only the drives `ada3` and `ada6` are monitored looks like
this:

```bash
./spindown_timer.sh -m -i ada3 -i ada6
```

It is also possible to run multiple instances of the script with independent
`TIMEOUT` values for different drives. In the following example, all drives
except `ada0` and `ada1` are spun down after being idle for 3600 seconds. The
drives `ada0` and `ada1` are instead already spun down after 600 seconds of
being considered as idle:

```bash
./spindown_timer.sh -t 3600 -i ada0 -i ada1    # Automatic drive detection
./spindown_timer.sh -m -t 600 -i ada0 -i ada1  # Manual mode
```

To verify the drive selection, a list of all drives that are being monitored by
the running script instance is printed directly after starting the script
(except in quiet mode [-q]).


### Automatic system shutdown [-s TIMEOUT]

When a timeout is given via the `-s` argument, the system will be shut down by
the script if all monitored drives were idle for the specified number of
seconds. This feature can be used to automatically shut down a system that might
be woken via wake-on-LAN (WOL) later on.

Setting `TIMEOUT` to 0 results in no shutdown.

## Warning

Heavily spinning disk drives up and down increases disk wear. Before deploying
this script, consider carefully which of your drives are frequently accessed and
should therefore not be aggressively spun down. A good rule of thumb is to keep
disk spin-ups below 5 per 24 hours. You can keep an eye on your drives
`Load_Cycle_Count` and `Start_Stop_Count` S.M.A.R.T values to monitor the number
of performed spin-ups.

**Please do not spin down your drives in an enterprise environment. Only
consider using this technique with small NAS setups for home use, which idle
most time of the day, and select a timeout value appropriate to your usage
behavior.**

Another typical use case is spinning down drives that are only used once a day
(e.g., for mirroring of files or backups).

## Attributions

The script is heavily inspired by:
[https://serverfault.com/a/969252](https://serverfault.com/a/969252)


## Example with 4 NAS drives:

Here im my NAS USB sticks are used as system-disks and you do NOT want to "spin-down" USB sticks, as they may explode or do some unwanted things.
So I copied the script to /usr/local/bin and call the manual mode:

/usr/local/bin/spindown_timer.sh -t 3000 -p 600 -m -i ada0 -i ada1 -i ada2 -i ada3

So this is 3000[s] / 60[s/min] = 50min

Why such a "long" time?

As one does not want to wear the disks my too many spindowns/spinups. If one goes away from the computer or goes to bed, 50 minutes
idle time is sufficient for detection but there are many cases where one just uses the nas for short durations and then re-uses it after
40 minutes or so, e.g. when writing a scientific document and storing some intermediate versions from time to time.
So 50 minutes is a quite good value.
